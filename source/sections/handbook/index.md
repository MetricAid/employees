##Introduction

Welcome to Catalyze! We’re excited to have you on our team. We’re on a mission to solve the compliance challenges facing healthcare technology vendors every day. Ask any health tech vendor or developer and they'll tell you the problems we are solving are very real, very tangible, and very immediately in need of better solutions. We don't build apps, except from time to time to test or dogfood our own stuff.

We're focused on infrastructure, specifically cloud-based software infrastructure, that makes it simpler for developers, vendors, and enterprises to build the tools necessary to fix healthcare. Healthcare is in need of a renaissance, and we want to help innovators bring about that paradigm shift. We're catalyzing (yes, the name was intentional) the disruption of healthcare with innovative technology and tech-enabled services built using Catalyze products. Our vision is to be *the* backbone, or plumbing, for healthcare technology, assuring the availability, privacy, security, and integrity of data.

As a company:

* we like to have fun;
* we work very hard;
* we learn constantly;
* we ask questions;
* we get better every day;
* we fight to win;
* we help each other;
* we love our customers;
* we are accountable;
* we accept failure but don't like it.
