##Compliance Policies

As an organization, compliance and security are at the core of what we do and how we operate. We publicly post our policies and procedures, and can be referenced whenever you have a question related to our policies. You can browse our policies [here](https://catalyze.io/policy/).

We are audited on an annual basis, and sometimes more frequently. In the case of an audit, we will inform all members of the company.
