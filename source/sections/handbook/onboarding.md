#Onboarding

As part of the onboarding process, you should have received and co-signed an offer letter and an at-will employment agreement. The at-will employment address areas related to intellectual property (IP), while the offer letter really just lays out the high level terms of employment. If you have not received these, please email [hr@catalyze.io](mailto:hr@catalyze.io)

One specific area to highlight and explain is option grants. Options give you the right, or option, to buy shares of Catalyze at a certain price. The terms for all option grants, other than the price of the options, are standardized for all employees at Catalyze; these terms mirror the terms of founders grants. Specifically, options are vested over 4 years with a 1 year cliff. What this means is that your options, if you choose to use them and buy shares, are not owned by you until they are vested. You would vest ¼ of your total shares after 12 months, and then 1/36 of the remaining shares on each month for the next 3 years. If you leave Catalyze before 12 months, you do not vest, or own any shares. If you leave between 12 months and 4 years, you would own or have vested a percentage of your shares. If you have any questions about options or terms, please email [hr@catalyze.io](mailto:hr@catalyze.io).

You should have received onboarding information from our HR and benefits companies. Currently we’re using Maxwell Health for insurance and we’re using inDinero for HR/Payroll.  We  direct deposit salary two times per month. We also offer full medical coverage through Group Health Cooperative and Catalyze covers 100% of the cost. If you have not received information from Maxwell and inDinero, and completed the paperwork for each, please email hr@catalyze.io. If you have questions about payroll or direct deposit, please email [inDinero](mailto:catalyze@indinero.com).

You each should have been issued a Mac Book Pro for use at Catalyze. This is for work use and, because of the nature of compliance, it is imperative that our workstation policies (firewall, encryption, passwords) are enforced. Specific policies for workstation uses can be found [here](https://catalyze.io/policy/#workstation-use). Please email if you have questions about any of these. The machine belongs to Catalyze Inc. and must be returned if you leave the company.
